## About
This is a script I made while browsing the forum and pulling out code for functions that I found useful. I then decided to combine all of it into one script. I made it for fun and spent most of my time playing around with the GUI, trying to make it look good.

This was created in 2020 and is now archived. As I delved deeper into programming, I realized AHK isn't ideal for building applications.

## Features:
* Set hotkeys to switch between windows
* Set a window's transparency
* Set a window to always be on top
* Screenshot an area on your computer and save it to your clipboard or to a folder automatically without needing to hit save. It also displays the image as a movable window if you want to keep it on hand.
* It grabs a colour anywhere on your desktop, adjusts the red, green, and blue values, and can produce a random colour for you.
* Can change the font and colour of the GUI. Make your own theme for it.
* Saves all your settings into a .ini file
